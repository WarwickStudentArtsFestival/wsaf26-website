        <Question>When will I hear back about my submission?</Question>
        <Answer>
          We&apos;re hoping to schedule all events on the weekend after

        <Question>
          I&apos;d just like to perform a short set individually. Is this
          possible?
        </Question>
        <Answer>
          Yes! Currently, we&apos;re planning on combining similar acts into
          larger events where there&apos;s a lot of interest, but if not
          we&apos;ll try to find a place to slot you into the schedule anyway.

        <Question>Can I still do my own marketing and advertising?</Question>
        <Answer>
          Absolutely! We want to help promote everyone&apos;s events as much as
          possible and are happy to work with you to do this. If you&apos;d like
          us not to advertise your event at all and do this yourself, please
          just let us know in the submissions form.

        <Question>How long can my performance be?</Question>
        <Answer>
          We&apos;re hoping for most shows to be shorter than 60 minutes, to
          allow people to see as much as possible over the weekend. We will,
          however, do our best to schedule any performance - in both 2024 and 2025 we had a{' '}
