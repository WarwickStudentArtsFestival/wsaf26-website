        <Question>
          I have exams or other commitments. Can I still help?
        </Question>
        <Answer>
          Yes - we need as much help as we can get, both in advance of the
          festival and on the day. Everything is done on a voluntary basis, so
          you get to choose what you want to work on. We only ask that you
          don&apos;t overcommit, and let us know as soon as possible if you can
          no longer do something.

        <Question>I have no experience. Can I still help?</Question>
        <Answer>
          Absolutely! You don&apos;t need to apply to help out - if you want to
          help in any team, you can! This is only the second time we&apos;re
          doing this, so if you think you have no clue what you&apos;re doing,
          we probably don&apos;t have much more of a clue...
