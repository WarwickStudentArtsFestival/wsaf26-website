        <Question>Why are you putting on this event?</Question>
        <Answer>
          The University of Warwick has a wealth of highly motivated student
          bands, theatre societies and other performing groups which we want to
          present to whole University community in the summer term. This is
          inspired by the old &apos;Warwick Student Arts Festival&apos;, which
          to our knowledge last took place in 2015.

          closely collaborated with university departments such as Marketing,
          Estates, AV Services and Conferences. Despite this, all decisions are
          still made by students!

          ?
        </Question>
        <Answer>
          WSAF&apos;s aim is to widen performance opportunities and to give
          people the chance to watch something that they might not have seen
          otherwise. We&apos;re providing a collection of a wider range of arts
          than a certain type of drama or society, but are more performance and
          arts-related than SocFest. You&apos;re more than welcome to submit and
          exhibit the same performance at both WSAF and another event.

          I&apos;ve found references to an older Warwick Student Arts Festival

          Yes! The Warwick Student Arts Festival used to be a yearly event from
          2004 to 2015, and we brought it back in 2024! You can find out more
